                    <h3>Eowyn</h3>
                    <p>It’s hard to notice when she’s there,<br>
                    That unwelcome visitor.<br>
                    Her intrusion in my life<br>
                    Is a constant ruination of my day.<br>
                    She haunts and taunts from the corner of my eye.<br>
                    Like a reminder of my own desperation,<br>
                    She calls for my attention despite knowing<br>
                    I’d never want it to be hers.<br>
                    The cowardice of her being,<br>
                    Never fully facing the world,<br>
                    Content to wallow in her sallow pallor.<br>
                    The scars she leaves on this world are temporary,<br>
                    But you will find them everywhere,<br>
                    In every deep recess and niche,<br>
                    Every cranny and corner,<br>
                    The evidence of her presence<br>
                    is inescapable.<br>
                    There when you leave,<br>
                    Awaiting your return.<br>
                    The sanctuary you once held sure,<br>
                    Tainted and tarnished,<br>
                    A shadow of what once was.<br>
                    The only thing she offers me<br>
                    Is the conviction,<br>
                    That I’ll never own a cat.</p>

                    <h3>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! </h3>
                    <p>Out there, there’s a plane, where remembrance fades and the<br>
                        Zeitgeist of the world has left you forgotten in the gutter.<br>
                        Your kingdom once stretched far, into distant horizons.<br>
                        Mighty was your roster, now faded from the wind and sands.<br>
                        Almost grasping godhood, your reach could not extend.<br>
                        Ne’er closer to the sun, than the day you were born icarus.<br>
                        Do not think that good night offers anything but gent.<br>
                        If words were your weapon, rust did away with them<br>
                        A long time ago. Nevertheless, being forgotten is a treasure.<br>
                        Solace, a gift. And yours, the greatest of all.</p>

                    <h3>Stagnant Silkworm</h3>
                    <p>Spin your little lies, and weave your tall tales.<br>
                        It’s through the distortions of your wake that<br>
                        The truth of all things becomes visible.<br>
                        Honesty never was your friend, and so you pushed her away,<br>
                        Further than she’d be, had you asked for her name.<br>
                        The things you care to hide, unseen as they are,<br>
                        Tell much about the truths you bury deep inside.<br>
                        With no sleeve to wear your heart on, it’s easy to see the scars.<br>
                        The pain that knows you well, can only fade, but never die.<br>
                        Stare long and hard, the abyss grows tired of your gaze.<br>
                        You can look but never touch, but what good are the senses,<br>
                        When everything else has betrayed you so far?<br>
                        I know the red you wear is the same shade as mine,<br>
                        But the lies I tell myself are beginning to flicker,<br>
                        Soon they’ll be no more. With the dying of that light,<br>
                        I’ll emerge a new being, that warm cocoon offers no comfort now.<br>
                        So let those chains go, the ones you hold oh so tight.<br>
                        I think we both know that they’ve been loose for a while.</p>

                    <h3>Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>I’d like to think that i would love the chance to cheat,<br>
                        to break a heart. To cause some pain from popularity,<br>
                        and have all i could surrounding me. Too stressed to decide<br>
                        cause my options are many. But i wake up and know that that isn’t my life.<br>
                        I cannot be yours cause you just don’t have time.<br>
                        I can’t break any hearts cause they always break mine.</p>

                    <h3>Sunsets</h3>
                    <p>I can’t see you in sunsets,<br>
                    Cause Those we never shared,<br>
                    You’d only call me after dark<br>
                    On nights you didn’t care<br><br>

                    Pretend that i don’t see the signs<br>
                    Make do like we’re complete<br>
                    Ignore the voice from everyone<br>
                    That’s telling me to leave<br><br>

                    And if we could be whole again<br>
                    she’d say we never were<br>
                    It’s far too late to lose my love<br>
                    But not too late for her<br><br>

                    haven’t had reason nor rhyme<br>
                    Wish things that i must not<br>
                    all we shared was borrowed time<br>
                    And i hoped god forgot<br><br>

                    It’s only when I think of you<br>
                    That heaven starts to sigh<br>
                    If words suffice to describe my plight<br>
                    I’d think that pigs would fly</p>
